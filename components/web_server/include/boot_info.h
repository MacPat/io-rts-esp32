// Restart diagnostics: why the board last restarted, how long it had been running and how low
// its free memory went before that, plus a boot counter. Costs no heap: the "previous run" data
// lives in RTC memory that survives a restart (but not a power cut), the counter lives in NVS.
// Also records the last failed memory allocation (size + task) and writes an hourly memory
// line to the pairing log, so a slow leak shows up as a trend that survives the crash.
